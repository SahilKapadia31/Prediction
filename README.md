# Prediction

`prediction` is a lightweight TypeScript library that provides search suggestions similar to Google's autocomplete feature. It helps improve user experience by suggesting relevant search queries as the user types.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install predict

```
## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the prediction library in a React application:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Prediction from 'prediction';

function SearchComponent() {
    const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
    const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);

    const handleInputChange = async (event) => {
        const userInput = event.target.value;
        setQuery(userInput);
        
        if (userInput.length > 2) { // Fetch suggestions only for input length > 2
            const results = await Prediction.getSuggestions(userInput);
            setSuggestions(results);
        } else {
            setSuggestions([]);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input 
                type="text" 
                value={query} 
                onChange={handleInputChange} 
                placeholder="Search..."
            />
            <ul>
                {suggestions.map((suggestion, index) => (
                    <li key={index}>{suggestion}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default SearchComponent;

```
